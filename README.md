# proto-playground

In this playground we are gonna visit how to set up proto-lens and all its goodness. To get all the good stuff we are going to stick with `master` branch of `proto-lens`, so there is gonna be a few extra steps involved. If you want to follow along rather than pull the repo here are the steps.

## Setup

I am going to use `stack` and `hpack` to set things up. So heeeeerrrrrreeeee weeeeee go:

### 1. Create a new stack project

`stack new proto-playground simple-hpack && cd proto-playground`

### 2. Setup proto

Now we have our top level project we are going to create a `proto` package inside:
`stack new proto simple-hpack`

We will setup the stuff in the project first before coming back to `proto-playground`. In our `proto/src` directory we will remove `Main.hs` and replace it with a `person.proto` file with the following contents:

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

message Person {
    string name = 1;
    int32 age = 2;

    // Address is a message defined somewhere else.
    repeated Address addresses = 3;
}

message Address {
  string street = 1;
  string zip_code = 2;
}
```

Next we will edit the `package.yaml` file to add in the things we need:

```yaml
name: person-proto

custom-setup:
  dependencies: base, Cabal, proto-lens-protoc

extra-source-files: src/**/*.proto

library:
  dependencies:
    - base
    - proto-lens
    - proto-lens-protoc

  exposed-modules:
    - Proto.Person
    - Proto.Person'Fields
```

This will autogenerate two modules `Proto.Person` where our records will be defined and `Proto.Person'Fields` where our field accessors will be defined.

The last thing we need to do here is edit `Setup.hs` to have:

```haskell
import Data.ProtoLens.Setup

main = defaultMainGeneratingProtos "src"
```

### 3. Setup proto-playground

Here we are going to be telling `proto-playground` how to find the proto stuff we just setup and how to grab the most up to date version of `proto-lens`. First thing to do will be to edit the `stack.yaml` file as follows:

1. Under `packages` we should have:

```yaml
packages:
- .
- proto
```

2. Under `packages` we will add a new field:

```yaml
- extra-dep: true
  location:
    git: https://github.com/google/proto-lens
    commit: master
  subdirs:
    - proto-lens
    - proto-lens-protoc
    - lens-labels
```

This last one says we will grab `proto-lens` from the github repo and use the `master` commit. It is better practice to clamp this to a certain commit in real projects.

Our final step will be to add `person-proto`, along with `default-data`, `microlens`, and `proto-lens`, to our dependencies in our main project like so:

```yaml
name:                proto-playgorund
version:             0.1.0.0

executables:
  proto-wtf:
    source-dirs:      src
    main:             Main.hs
```

Alright! Let us test this puppy out! We will make a `Main.hs` in our main project so we can create and print some stuff out!

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

module Main where

import Proto.Person as P
import Proto.Person'Fields as P
import Data.Default
import Data.ProtoLens (showMessage)
import Lens.Micro

person :: P.Person
person =
  def & P.name      .~ "Fintan"
      & P.age       .~ 24
      & P.addresses .~ [address]
  where
    address :: P.Address
    address =
      def & P.street  .~ "Yolo street"
          & P.zipCode .~ "D8"


main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn . showMessage $ person
```

### Troubleshooting

You may run into issues with not being able to find names and what not when trying to run `stack build`. If this is occurring then try do a `stack clean --full` and try `stack build` again.

### Finding autogenerated files

The autogenerated files will be located in your `proto` directories `.stack-work`. If you want inspect any of the files you can open them open :)

To find the ones we create you can run:
`find . -name Person.hs`

## What do we get?

### Message and Lenses

When we build our protobuffers what is it we get? Code is autogenerated to give us two files `Person.hs` and `Person'Fields.hs` which contain our records and our field accessors respectively. This is roughly what they look like:

```haskell
-- Person.hs

module Proto.Person where
-- imports

data Address = Address{_Address'street :: !Data.Text.Text,
                       _Address'zipCode :: !Data.Text.Text,
                       _Address'_unknownFields :: !Data.ProtoLens.FieldSet}
             deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

instance (Lens.Labels.HasLens' f Address x a, a ~ b) =>
         Lens.Labels.HasLens f Address Address x a b
-- instance definition

instance Prelude.Functor f =>
         Lens.Labels.HasLens' f Address "street" (Data.Text.Text)
         where
-- instance definition

instance Prelude.Functor f =>
         Lens.Labels.HasLens' f Address "zipCode" (Data.Text.Text)
-- instance definition

instance Data.Default.Class.Default Address where
-- instance definition

instance Data.ProtoLens.Message Address where
-- instance definition

data Person = Person{_Person'name :: !Data.Text.Text,
                     _Person'age :: !Data.Int.Int32, _Person'addresses :: ![Address],
                     _Person'_unknownFields :: !Data.ProtoLens.FieldSet}
            deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

-- same instances with different labels
```

```haskell
-- Person'Fields.hs

module Proto.Person'Fields where
-- imports

addresses ::
          forall f s t a b . (Lens.Labels.HasLens f s t "addresses" a b) =>
            Lens.Family2.LensLike f s t a b
addresses
  = Lens.Labels.lensOf
      ((Lens.Labels.proxy#) :: (Lens.Labels.Proxy#) "addresses")

age ::
    forall f s t a b . (Lens.Labels.HasLens f s t "age" a b) =>
      Lens.Family2.LensLike f s t a b
age
  = Lens.Labels.lensOf
      ((Lens.Labels.proxy#) :: (Lens.Labels.Proxy#) "age")

name ::
     forall f s t a b . (Lens.Labels.HasLens f s t "name" a b) =>
       Lens.Family2.LensLike f s t a b
name
  = Lens.Labels.lensOf
      ((Lens.Labels.proxy#) :: (Lens.Labels.Proxy#) "name")

street ::
       forall f s t a b . (Lens.Labels.HasLens f s t "street" a b) =>
         Lens.Family2.LensLike f s t a b
street
  = Lens.Labels.lensOf
      ((Lens.Labels.proxy#) :: (Lens.Labels.Proxy#) "street")

zipCode ::
        forall f s t a b . (Lens.Labels.HasLens f s t "zipCode" a b) =>
          Lens.Family2.LensLike f s t a b
zipCode
  = Lens.Labels.lensOf
      ((Lens.Labels.proxy#) :: (Lens.Labels.Proxy#) "zipCode")
```

So we have our data types for Person and Address and they have instances for:

* HasLens
* HasLens'
  * Allows us to use lenses for interacting with our data i.e. get/set
* Default
  * Protobuffers have many default values for built in types. This allows us to default them and also forget about the pesky `*'_unknownFields` that appears in our record definition.
* Message
  * As mentioned here https://github.com/google/proto-lens/blob/master/proto-lens/src/Data/ProtoLens/Message.hs#L70-L73
    Every protocol buffer is an instance of 'Message'.
    This class enables serialization by providing reflection of all of the fields that may be used by this type.

### Building a Message

Using your favourite lens library we can create our proto data by doing the following:

```haskell
import Proto.Person as P
import Proto.Person'Fields as P

fintan :: P.Person                      -- Signal the compiler what we are creating a Person
fintan = def & P.name      .~ "Fintan"  -- set the `name` of our person
             & P.age       .~ 24        -- set the `age` of our person
             & P.addresses .~ addresses -- set the `addresses` of our person
```
